# API Testing and Tracking

### Steps to use:

1. Install the [VS Code Extension : Thunder Client](vscode:extension/rangav.vscode-thunder-client) and access from the left panel.

2. To **Load / Import** the collections into your Thunder Client, run the below command:
```
npm run thunder-import
```
3. Test, modify, and create new collections or requests. 

4. To **Save / Export** the collections into your project folder, run the below command:
```
npm run thunder-export
```

>**Note** : If you encounter path related error, it may be because you have never installed this extension or created a collection before. For this, create a temporary collection in your Thunder Client (this will create the correct path in your os).
